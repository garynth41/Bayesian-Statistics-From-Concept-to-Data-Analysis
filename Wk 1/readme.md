# Probability and Bayes' Theorem
In this module, we review the basics of probability and Bayes’ theorem. In Lesson 1, we introduce the different paradigms or definitions of probability and discuss why probability provides a coherent framework for dealing with uncertainty. In Lesson 2, we review the rules of conditional probability and introduce Bayes’ theorem. Lesson 3 reviews common probability distributions for discrete and continuous random variables.

## Module 1 objectives, assignments, and supplementary materials
Learning Objectives 
Upon successful completion of Module 1, you will be able to: 

+ Understand the different definitions of probability. 
+ Understand the meaning of conditional probability. 
+ Compute conditional probabilities using Bayes’ theorem. 
+ Understand probability distributions, including probability density functions. 
+ Compute probabilities of outcomes for basic distributions.

## Assignments 
This module has four required quizzes and an honors quiz. A score of 75% is required to pass. Quizzes can be attempted up to four times in an eight-hour period.

## Additional Materials
In addition to regular lectures and quizzes, this module includes the following materials.

## Lesson 1: Probability 
+ Background reading: This reviews the rules of probability, odds, and expectation. 
+ Discussion prompt: Read what your peers have to say about the prompt and share your ideas on the discussion board.
+ Lesson 2: Bayes’ theorem 
+ Supplementary reading: This optional reading extends Bayes’ theorem beyond just two possibilities. It will also be helpful for the Lesson 2 quiz. 

## Lesson 3: Review of distributions 
Supplementary reading: This reading provides a vital reference for future lessons. It includes a review of indicator functions; expectation and variance; important probability distributions that will be used throughout the course (some not included in the lesson videos); the central limit theorem; and the continuous version of Bayes’ theorem.
